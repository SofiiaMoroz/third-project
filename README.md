This is my third project on my way to learn Angular. 

In this project I was **again practicing with** component communication:
- custom property binding
- custom event bunding

Also I **learned** next topics: 
- view encapsulation
- local references (@ViewChild)
- ng-content (@ContentChild)
- understanding the component lifecycle
- lifecycle hooks
